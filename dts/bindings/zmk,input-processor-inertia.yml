properties:
  decay-factor-int:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 90
    description: |
      The decay factor, expressed as an integer percentage (0-100).
      This determines how quickly the inertia velocity decreases in each interval.
      A value of 85 means the velocity is multiplied by 0.85 (85/100) per interval.
      
  report-interval-ms:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 35
    description: |
      The time interval, in milliseconds (ms), between each decay calculation and 
      pointer HID report transmission. This should typically match the sensor 
      polling rate (e.g., 15ms or 16ms).
  
  threshold-start:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 15
    description: |
      The minimum velocity magnitude (in dx/dy units) required to activate inertial movement. 
      Inertia is triggered if the cursor's speed upon release is faster than this threshold.

  threshold-stop:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 1
    description: |
      The minimum velocity magnitude (in dx/dy units) required to continue the inertia calculation. 
      When both current_vx and current_vy drop below this threshold, inertia stops.
      
  scroll-decay-factor-int:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 85
    description: |
      The decay factor for scrolling, expressed as an integer percentage (0-100).
      
  scroll-report-interval-ms:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 65
    description: |
      The time interval, in milliseconds (ms), between each scroll decay calculation.

  scroll-threshold-start:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 2
    description: |
      The minimum velocity magnitude required to activate scroll inertia.
      
  scroll-threshold-stop:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 0
    description: |
      The minimum velocity magnitude to continue scroll inertia.
